# Sign-in flow

**Problem:** When chatting with Expedia’s virtual agent, customers had to exit the chat to sign into their account.
**Solution:** Create a “Sign-in card” that lets users sign in or find a booking with other details, all without exiting the chat window.
**My role:** UX Content Strategist

## Successful sign-in with bookings

### Content notes

- “OK, let’s do it.” acknowledges the customer’s intent, and confirms the Virtual Agent’s (VA) ability to help.
- If the user checked out as a guest, they need the option to search that way. Directional text above the buttons provides a simple explanation of both actions.
- “✅ Success, you’re signed in!” gives a quick confirmation of sign-in success. It’s followed by a “wait” message that actually cycles through a few possible iterations; variation of this interstitial humanizes the Virtual Agent.

## Alternate scenarios

### Content notes

- Check out the variation on the “wait” message 🙂
- Since we really only searched for upcoming bookings, we’ll provide options for a user to see other bookings they might be searching for. An initial assumption on our part that they’d be looking for upcoming, but still a smooth experience for the alternative.
- The “Search as a guest” experience is still conversational — plenty of room to grow using an inline card or form for this as well!
