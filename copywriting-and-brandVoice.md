**My role(s):** Community Manager & Social Media Manager

***My work at Microsoft was about guiding users to relevant solutions with clear and compelling copy.***

I started at Microsoft as a Community Manager, where I engaged with audiences 1-to-1 on Twitter & Facebook. See the writing style guide I built for [Office SMB](https://twitter.com/OfficeSmallBiz) below.

In my role as Social Media Manager, I took content from the IT Showcase team and amplified it over social media channels throughout Microsoft. It required an ability to determine the relevant information from a variety of sources and broadcast that knowledge in a sentence or two.

I won't claim to be an expert on [Azure SQL Database](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itshowcase/creating-business-intelligence-with-azure-sql-database), for example; my expertise is in understanding what an audience [needs to know](https://twitter.com/Azure/status/1151974934446563329) so that they want to find out more.
