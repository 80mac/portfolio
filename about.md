Currently, I’m building the Conversation Platform at Expedia Group. My team and I are mapping conversations, conducting research, and learning how to build for all users regardless of ability. 

I’m particularly interested in accessible & equitable content design. As part of an internal group of accessibility champions at Expedia Group, I’ve been applying accessible design patterns to the components of our chat window.
