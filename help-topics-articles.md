## Structuring help topics

**My role:** UX Content Strategist

I write help topics at Expedia with two things at the top of my mind: scannability & re-usability. We want readers to drop in, find what they’re searching for, and head back to the main site to take action.

Here are a few articles I edited to be more conversational in tone and provide more information in less words.

**My role:** Social Media Manager (acting as UX Writer 😉)

I re-worked a long-standing yearly article that covers IT Showcase’s involvement in Microsoft’s Ignite conference. Historically, the article had been great for those attending the conference but less than useful for the majority of readers.
