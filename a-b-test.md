# Find a guest booking... but how?

**Problem:** When someone checks out (buys something) as a guest on an Expedia Group site, they’re given a few pieces of identifying information. We wanted to create a way to find a booking using any of these pieces of info within the chat window.
**Solution:** Test 2 options — would users rather input information in a form or via chat?

**Our results showed that users prefer the conversational approach, and convincingly so.**

1. The form is a webview — opening a new window within the chat window sometimes throws users off.
2. In trying to allow input of a number of different pieces of identifying info, the cognitive load just became too much. With 2 possible inputs per field, users might have been confused as to what was actually needed.
3. Security — in other projects, we found that users were sometimes wary of inputting personal info in forms that opened within the chat window as it felt less secure than typing directly into the chat.
