# Social graphic re-vamp

**Problem:** Our social imagery was static and left valuable real estate unused on social feeds.
**Solution:** Design frames with a place for heading, subheading, and cohesive hashtag.
**My role:** Creative Director

**Context:** At Microsoft, I pitched social content for Core Services Engineering & Operations (basically, the IT organization) to many other channels around Microsoft. We didn’t own a social channel because our content engine covered a wide range of topics. I got to collaborate with many different teams, but it led to a lack of cohesion among our posts. To fix this, I initiated a re-vamp of our social graphics.

## Step 1: Find a designer

I sent a proposal similar to this one to each design team before chatting with them.

## Step 2: Create the frames

I worked closely with the designer to honor Microsoft brand guidelines, develop a set of PSDs that I’d be able to work with, and achieve my overall vision.

## Step 3: Launch the new look!

Before our re-vamp, CSEO sent posts to channels with an unaltered image. The images are good; we take photos of the project managers at Microsoft featured in our content. But they don’t grab attention well on social media.

Below is a before-and-after view of the image sent out with [this blog](https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/blog/onedrive-for-business-feature-shifts-how-employees-save-files-within-microsoft/).

The frames are straightforward by design. I wanted them to grab attention with a succinct headline and CTA while honoring our authentic imagery. I’m happy with the results. See more examples below.

*I was not in the position long enough to track the results of this re-vamp, but I know the frames were used by the next Social Media Manager.*
